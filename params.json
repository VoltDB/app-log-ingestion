The logs are pushed to configured kafka cluster.\r\nA kafka stream based bulkloading application then pulls and loads the log data in VoltDB.\r\nVoltDB is pupulated with event data and materialized view created for easy access.\r\nPeriodically OLD log data is deleted if specified.\r\n\r\nCode organization\r\n-----------------\r\nThe code is divided into projects:\r\n\r\n- \"events-db\": the database project, which contains the schema, stored procedures and other configurations that are compiled into a catalog and run in a VoltDB database.  \r\n- \"ksyslogd\": a java client that listens for log data on 1514 port and pushes them to specified Kafka cluster.\r\n- \"nibbler\": a java client that calls VoltDB and periodically deletes old events (cruft removal) This is optional step but make sure your VoltDB cluster can handle the events data ingestion.\r\n\r\nSee below for instructions on running these applications.  For any questions, \r\nplease contact fieldengineering@voltdb.com.\r\n\r\nPre-requisites\r\n--------------\r\nBefore running these scripts you need to have VoltDB 4.3 (Enterprise or Community) or later installed, and you should add the voltdb-$(VERSION)/bin directory to your PATH environment variable, for example:\r\n\r\n    export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/voltdb-ent-4.3/bin\"\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Start the database (in the background)\r\n\r\n    cd events-db\r\n    ./run.sh\r\n     \r\n2. Run the ksyslogd server\r\n\r\n    cd ksyslogd\r\n    - Get syslog4j-0.9.30.jar and copy it under lib directory\r\n    - Make sure that machine where ksyslogd is going to run is getting syslog forwarded on port 1514\r\n    - ant jar\r\n    - ./startsyslogpush kafka-broker (host:port) [listener-ip-for-syslog-events]\r\n\r\n4. Start kafkaloader\r\n\r\n    kafkaloader -z kafka-zookeeper -t topic events\r\n\r\n5. Start nibbler (If you wish to delete old event data)\r\n    cd nibbler\r\n    ./run.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Run various queries to get event data by connecting to VoltDB server.\r\n\r\nInstructions for running on a cluster\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTake compiled catalog and run it on a cluster by setting correct deployment. Use VoltDB enterprise manager.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
